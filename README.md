# Snooplay - A Media Player for Sub Reddits #
Snooplay is a media player for Sub Reddits. It is built using React, Redux & React Router. The app uses Reddit API for 
fetching page by page data filters all media content (Videos, Images, Gifs & Image Galleries) to show in an easy to use 
layout.

I often use /r/music to listen to Music, and opening YouTube links and closing them was not the best way to do so, so I built Snooplay.

# Learning React #
Snooplay is primarily a learning exercise. [v1](https://github.com/anirudhvarma12/snooplay/tree/v1) was the first attempt at learning
React, v2 incorporates React-router for routing & redux for state management. The earlier version only worked for YouTube videos, v2 works
for most embedded media.
